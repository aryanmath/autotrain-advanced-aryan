# Text Classification

Training a text classification model with AutoTrain is super-easy! Get your data ready in
proper format and then with just a few clicks, your state-of-the-art model will be ready to
be used in production.

## Data Format

Let's train a model for classifying the sentiment of a movie review. The data should be
in the following CSV format:

```csv
review,sentiment
"this movie is great",positive
"this movie is bad",negative
.
.
.
```

As you can see, we have two columns in the CSV file. One column is the text and the other
is the label. The label can be any string. In this example, we have two labels: `positive`
and `negative`. You can have as many labels as you want.

## Training

Once you have duplicated the AutoTrain Advanced space, you can start training your model.
Please always factory reset the space to make sure your have the latest version of the AutoTrain Advanced.
