# Model Choice

AutoTrain can automagically select the best models for your task! However, you are also
allowed to choose the models you want to use. You can choose the most appropriate models
from the Hugging Face Hub.

# AutoTrain Model Choice

To let AutoTrain choose the best models for your task, you can use the "AutoTrain"

# Manual Model Choice

To choose the models manually, you can use the "HuggingFace Hub" in the "Model Choice" section.
For example, if you want to use Deberta V3 Base for your task from https://huggingface.co/microsoft/deberta-v3-base,
You can choose "HuggingFace Hub" and then write the model name: `microsoft/deberta-v3-base` in the model name field.
