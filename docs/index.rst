AutoNLP: Auto training and fast deployment for state-of-the-art NLP models

AutoNLP is an automatic way to train, evaluate and deploy state-of-the-art NLP models for different tasks. 
Using AutoNLP, you can leave all the worries of selecting the best model, fine-tuning the model or even deploying the models and
focus on the broader picture for your project/business.

Main features:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Automatic selection of best models given your data
 - Automatic fine-tuning
 - Automatic hyperparameter optimization
 - Model comparison after training
 - Immediate deployment after training
 - CLI and Python API available

Supported Tasks
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Currently, AutoNLP supports the following tasks:

- Binary classification: one sentence has one target associated with it and there are two unique targets in the dataset
